## The Intersection of Generative AI and Computational Design

Foundation models such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized creative processes, particularly in computational design. These models can produce thousands of visual and textual outputs, offering unprecedented inspiration for creative endeavors. While we have rapidly adopted these technologies as collaborative tools, I argue that we have yet to harness their full potential. Current interaction paradigms often guide users toward premature convergence on a limited set of ideas, rather than empowering them to explore the vast latent design spaces that generative models offer.

My research focuses on the transformative potential of generative AI in computational design, particularly in creative processes like building automata and kinematics. These foundation models are revolutionizing the field by enabling the rapid production of diverse mechanical and computational designs, thus serving as invaluable tools for innovation and problem-solving.

## Mechanical Automata: A Compelling Research Domain

Mechanical crafts, commonly known as automata, represent an interdisciplinary medium that combines mechanical engineering, art, craft, and storytelling. Historically rooted in the intricate craftsmanship of clockwork and timepieces, automata have evolved into modern expressions of kinetic art and engaging learning tools. Their interdisciplinary nature makes automata a powerful medium for creative expression and education, appealing to makers of all ages.

Building automata is an engaging yet complex process that blends creativity with problem-solving. Makers begin by ideating what to create—often a character or object, such as an elephant—and identifying which parts to animate, like its legs or trunk. Next, they design the mechanisms needed to achieve the desired motion, such as combining gears, joints, or linkages. Once the design is finalized, the fabrication process demands thorough planning and precision to successfully create a functional automation.

This domain presents unique challenges that generative AI can address, while also serving as an ideal testbed for exploring human-AI collaboration in design.

## AI in Computational Design: Capabilities and Limitations

AI in computational design acts as a transformative auxiliary, significantly enhancing efficiency and innovation through multiple roles:

1. **Concept Generation**: AI excels in rapidly ideating diverse concepts, enabling designers to explore a wide range of creative possibilities quickly. This function streamlines the brainstorming process by providing initial ideas based on predefined parameters, constraints, and design goals.

2. **Generation of Design Variants**: AI facilitates the rapid production of diverse design alternatives, eliminating extensive manual effort and reducing dependency on iterative trial-and-error methods.

3. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**: AI automates routine tasks such as parametric modeling and base template creation, liberating creators to focus on more creative and complex challenges.

4. **Trend Prediction and Analysis**: By analyzing historical data and current industry trends, AI can forecast emerging design patterns, offering creators a competitive edge in anticipating market needs.

These functions are encapsulated in the concept of Generative Design, where AI uses specified parameters to autonomously generate a range of design options. This capability positions AI not merely as a tool, but as an integral collaborator in the creative process.

### Benefits of AI in Computational Design

- **Efficiency**: AI can save countless hours of brainstorming, sketching, and iterative design, handling repetitive tasks while designers focus on creative aspects.

- **Precision**: AI can significantly reduce the margin of error by analyzing vast amounts of data and making accurate predictions, whether for design optimization or structural analysis.

- **Personalization**: AI excels at creating highly personalized user experiences by analyzing behavior and preferences, increasing engagement and effectiveness.

### Limitations and Challenges

- **Complexity in Implementation**: AI integration into design workflows requires a deep understanding of both AI mechanisms and user intent. AI and systems researchers often focus primarily on enhancing model performance rather than supporting creative co-creation processes with designers.

- **Dependability Issues**: AI effectiveness is inherently tied to the quality of underlying data. The principle of "garbage in, garbage out" holds true—flawed data results in flawed outputs. Users may not detect how data quality affects outcomes.

- **Loss of Human Touch**: AI cannot replicate the nuanced creativity and emotional depth imparted by human designers. AI-generated designs often lack the distinctive artistic touch that defines compelling aesthetics and resonates on a human level.

## Research Agenda

My research aims to address both the "human touch" limitations and reduce "complexity" in AI-assisted design, with a particular focus on mechanical automata and kinematics. I am exploring three interconnected research directions:

### 1. Learning to Learn: AI in Creative Processes

How can we effectively teach designers to use AI in their creative environment while balancing dependability and originality? This research direction involves developing educational frameworks and tools that help designers understand how to effectively collaborate with AI while maintaining their creative vision. Key questions include:

- How can we measure originality in AI-assisted creation?
- What constitutes the core of the design thought process when working with AI?
- How can we develop tools that educate users about AI capabilities while encouraging creative exploration?

### 2. Computational Design with Human Intent

There is growing concern about designers relying heavily on AI-generated content at the expense of creative authenticity. When designers request specific features (e.g., an automaton with particular movement characteristics), AI might generate something different. Instead of revisiting their original intent, designers often adapt to the AI output, potentially compromising their creative vision.

My research explores methods to:

- Preserve human intent throughout the AI-assisted design process
- Develop interaction models that keep designers' original goals at the forefront
- Create feedback mechanisms that help designers recognize when they're diverging from their initial vision

### 3. Software Toolkits for AI-Assisted Mechanical Design

Despite the accessibility of natural language interfaces for LLMs ("prompting"), crafting effective prompts remains challenging and often results in brittle interactions. My research aims to develop specialized tools for non-expert users working on mechanical design projects, with a focus on:

- Creating domain-specific interfaces for automata and kinematic design
- Developing visual programming approaches that combine natural language with direct manipulation
- Building tools that help users understand the relationship between their inputs and AI-generated outputs

## Conclusion

The integration of generative AI into computational design, particularly for mechanical systems like automata, represents a frontier with immense potential. By addressing the current limitations in human-AI creative collaboration, my research aims to develop new paradigms, tools, and methodologies that empower designers to fully leverage AI capabilities while maintaining their creative vision and intent.

Through this work, I seek to transform how designers interact with AI—not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a powerful collaborator that expands the boundaries of what's possible in computational design.
