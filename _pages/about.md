I am a Master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Korea University working with Prof. Jong-Kook Kim. Also, I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [Protopia AI inc.](https://protopia.ai/) at Austin, Texas. Protopia AI inc. is an AI privacy start-up lead by [Dr. Eiman Ebrahimi](http://eimanebrahimi.com/) and [Prof. Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/). In Protopia AI, I developed a few internal frameworks and libraries to support privacy-preserving machine learning from distributed ML frameworks with cloud computing.

I have 5+ years of industry experience as a software engineer in various layers of distributed system, machine learning systems and cloud computing. During the period, I was a AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador of Amazon Web Service (AWS) Educate. I also have profound experience developing distributed frameworks on cloud, models using PyTorch, and deploying models using ONNX.

Prior to my Master studies, I got my B.Eng in Electical Engineering from Korea University, and worked at Multiple Startups as a Cloud Architect and Software Engineer.
