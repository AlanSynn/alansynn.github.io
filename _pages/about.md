I am a Research Scientist at [Protopia AI inc.](https://protopia.ai/) at Austin, Texas. Protopia AI inc. is an AI privacy start-up led by [Dr. Eiman Ebrahimi](http://eimanebrahimi.com/) and [Prof. Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/). In Protopia AI, I developed and maintained internal frameworks and libraries to support privacy-preserving machine learning with distributed ML frameworks and cloud computing. Before that,

I have 5+ years of industry experience as a software engineer in various layers of distributed system, machine learning system and cloud computing. During the period, I was a AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador of Amazon Web Service. I also have profound experience developing distributed frameworks on cloud, models using PyTorch, and deploying models using ONNX.

Prior to my Master studies, I got my M.Eng and B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from Korea University advised by Prof. Jong-Kook Kim, and worked at Multiple Startups as a Cloud Architect and Software Engineer.
