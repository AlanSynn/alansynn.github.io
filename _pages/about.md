I am a PhD Student in the fields of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests span Distributed systems, Cloud Computing, and System for AI. Before I get into PhD program, I worked as a software engineer for 8+ years in various layers of distributed system, machine learning system and cloud computing.

During the period, I was a Research Scientist at [Protopia AI inc.](https://protopia.ai/) which is a AI company mainly tackles for privacy in Austin, Texas. In Protopia AI, I develop and maintain internal frameworks and libraries to support privacy-preserving machine learning with distributed ML frameworks and cloud computing. And I was a AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador of Amazon Web Service. I have profound experience developing distributed frameworks on cloud, models using PyTorch, and deploying models using ONNX.

I received M.Eng and B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Korea University advised by Prof. Jong-Kook Kim. My research at Korea University focused on Machine Learning Systems and Distributed Systems.
