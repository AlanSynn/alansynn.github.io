I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research explores the intersection of generative AI and computational design, particularly in creative processes like building automata and kinematics. I investigate how foundation models can revolutionize mechanical and computational design by enabling rapid production of diverse solutions while preserving human creative intent.

My work addresses three key challenges in AI-assisted design: (1) developing educational frameworks that help designers effectively collaborate with AI while maintaining their creative vision, (2) preserving human intent throughout the AI-assisted design process, and (3) creating specialized tools for non-expert users working on mechanical design projects.

Throughout my career, I have developed and implemented a wide range of solutions, from government-led programming education initiatives to advanced ubiquitous computing stacks. My background includes significant experience as a cloud architect, where I have designed social robots, optimized cloud-native software and managed DevOps infrastructures for various companies.

I received M.Eng and B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Korea University advised by Prof. Jong-Kook Kim. My research at Korea University focused on Machine Learning Systems and Distributed Systems.
