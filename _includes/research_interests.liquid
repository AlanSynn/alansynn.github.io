            My research explores the intersection of generative AI and computational design, particularly in creative
            processes like building automata
            and kinematics. I investigate how foundation models can revolutionize mechanical and computational design by
            enabling rapid production of
            diverse solutions while preserving human creative intent.

            I focus on three key challenges: (1) developing educational frameworks that help designers effectively
            collaborate with AI while
            maintaining their creative vision, (2) preserving human intent throughout the AI-assisted design process,
            and (3) creating specialized
            tools for non-expert users working on mechanical design projects.
